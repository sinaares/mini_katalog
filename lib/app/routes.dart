// This class is used to keep all route names in one place.
// By defining them as constants, I avoid writing route strings manually in different files.
class Routes {
  // Route for the splash screen (first screen when the app starts)
  static const splash = '/';

  // Route for the home screen
  static const home = '/home';

  // Route for the detail screen (shows selected product details)
  static const detail = '/detail';

  // Route for the settings screen
